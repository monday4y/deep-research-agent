# 🧠 Deep Research Agent

**Deep Research Agent** is an AI-powered system that performs autonomous, multi-step web research using modular agents. Built with modern agentic frameworks, it simulates a research assistant that reads, analyzes, summarizes, and synthesizes answers from the web to fulfill complex queries.

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Autonomous research with multiple specialized agents
- 🔗 Web search and document retrieval (via Tavily API or custom integration)
- 📚 Source-aware synthesis and citation
- 🧠 Summarization, critique, and re-evaluation of sources
- 🧩 Built using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and optionally **Tavily**, **LlamaIndex**, **RAG pipelines**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool         | Purpose                         |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| `LangGraph`  | Agent state machine & orchestration |
| `LangChain`  | LLM interaction, tools, memory    |
| `Tavily API` | Web search for up-to-date info    |
| `Python`     | Core implementation               |
| `OpenAI GPT` | Natural language reasoning        |
| `ChromaDB` / `FAISS` | (Optional) Vector storage for memory and recall |

## 🧩 Agent Architecture

The system follows a **modular agent design**, including:

- **Research Agent**: Queries the web, fetches relevant information.
- **Reading Agent**: Summarizes and critiques documents.
- **Analysis Agent**: Compares and contrasts findings.
- **Synthesis Agent**: Writes a final answer with citations.
- **Supervisor Agent**: Manages task flow, verifies quality.

Each agent has a clearly defined role and memory scope, managed via LangGraph state transitions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Input** → Natural language query (e.g., “What are the pros and cons of nuclear fusion?”)
2. **Research Agent** → Finds top search results, filters sources.
3. **Reading Agent** → Summarizes each source.
4. **Analysis Agent** → Compares perspectives and contradictions.
5. **Synthesis Agent** → Drafts final response with citations.
6. **Supervisor** → Validates and optionally prompts re-research.
